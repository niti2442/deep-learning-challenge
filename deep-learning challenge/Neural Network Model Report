Neural Network Model Report

For this part of the assignment, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
-The targeted variable is the IS_SUCCESSFUL column from application_df.

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
-The feature variables are the other columns from application_df.
-They include the following:
   -application_type
   -affiliation
   -classification
   -use_case
   -organization
   -status
   -income_amt
   -special_considerations
   -ask_amt
   -is_successful

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
-Both 'EIN' and 'Name' columns were removed because they are neither targets nor features. 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
-I just used 4 and 5 randomly.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
-No, because they were guesses. I was not able to achieve the accuracy of over 75% that was needed.

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
-I tried to use different layers and add and remove more columns to see if higher model accuracy could be in affect.

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
-The model needed to be 75% accurate in predicting the problem. Using the model with greater correlation would provide more accurate results and have a higher percentage. This could be done by adding and remove columns and also maybe working with a different number of functions.
